**Cleaning Service Management System (SQL)**
Project Overview
This repository contains a robust Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) designed to manage the operations of a cleaning service business. This project was developed as a major assignment for the Database module at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. It showcases the ability to translate complex business requirements into a functional SQL database with high data integrity.

**Key Features**
  Relational Schema Design: Implements a normalized structure with entities for Customers, Staff, Services, and Bookings.
  
  Data Integrity & Constraints: Utilizes Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and CHECK constraints to ensure data accuracy and relational consistency.
  
  Automated Data Migration: Includes scripts for BULK INSERT to efficiently migrate data from external CSV files into the SQL Server environment.
  
  Business Intelligence Queries: Features advanced SQL queries to generate reports on revenue, staff performance, and customer booking trends.
